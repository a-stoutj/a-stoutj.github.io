          <p>Well dear reader, you random internet stranger, here we are. My name is Austin Stout. I’m 22 years old. I am seeking employment while finishing my linguistics degree at Stanford University this fall. I built a website mainly to show off my resume, but also because I find technology interesting and also have developed a pattern of building my own things. This summer, I started a podcast. I learned how to make bread, cheese, and beer. I learned some html and css to build this site of #selfbranding, and I’ve decided I might as well add a blog to it because I’m trying to be more introspective. But now whoever finds this website can read my thoughts (Hello future employer!). I’m gonna try to post weekly or so as I learn more about html and work on other projects, and this blog probably won’t be off the cuff hot takes documenting my every feeling. Because once again, employment is the goal.<br/>
            <br/>

          Some more about me: The things that drive me are 1) learning, 2) relationships, 3) be a better me. I try to do the “right” thing, whether that be dictated by philosophy, religious upbringing, or doing whats best for the people around me. I’m a straight white male. I’m a progressive. I’m stoic. I try to think through things logically rather than feeling emotion. I have introverted tendencies and struggle with meeting new people, but once I consider a person a friend I’ll stand by them. <br/>
<br/>

          I think food and flavor is the fundamental pleasure in human existence. Probably will post something going further into that.<br/>
<br/>
          I enjoy debating with people, perhaps to a fault. <br/><br/>

          I love words, from reading to talking about their usage to debating their meaning — I spend a significant amount of time searching for the perfect word to describe a sentiment. I enjoy music, from the nerdy side of music theory I learned from my 8 years of saxophone lessons and band to the current hip hop and pop music. I enjoy exercise, but will be more likely to work out if I have a partner to do it with. I was a rower in high school and miss the water. I want to get more into cycling. I love college football and basketball, specifically the Michigan Wolverines and Stanford Cardinal. I fantasize about doing my own Walden Pond type experience. I want to hike the pacific crest trail. I want to bike across the country. I love seasonal change — My favorite is fall, and I hope to one day settle down in the Pacific Northwest. I want to create things, but don’t think I’m creative enough to pull it off. So this blog is an experiment.<br/><br/>

          I’m sitting on a plane flying back to the Bay Area from my home town of Ann Arbor. I’m flying back to Stanford too finish my degree. I have some anxiety about going back — my friends are all graduated, I feel lonely, and last year I felt simultaneously out of control and trapped by my classes, my relationships, and my anxiety, but now I feel more grounded. I just want a change. I feel ready to move on to the real world, but am stuck for 3 more months in school and yes, searching for a job. <br/><br/>
